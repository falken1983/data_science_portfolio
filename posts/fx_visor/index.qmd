`fx_visor` is a simple [**Streamlit**](https://streamlit.io)-based web application.

Comparative time-series visualizations brings in a key component of financial analysis in order to get the intuition of trendy and underperforming financial assets.

`fx_visor` is the data visualization module of the data project [`fx_letor`](https://github.com/falken1983/fx_letor) with the aim to predict rankings of a set of currencies by means of Machine Learning _Learning-to-Rank_ models. This could facilitate investment decision making, easing dynamic portfolio construction.

Both `fx_visor`and `fx_letor` are currently under development.
