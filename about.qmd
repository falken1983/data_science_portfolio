I am a Sr. Quantitative Risk Analyst at CaixaBank. I have extensive background working with financial data sets and using advanced mathematical implementation to enable risk calculation and control of financial market positions of the bank.

I recently expanded my skill set to include topics like Quarto, Tableau, `statmodels`, `scikit-learn`, `pytorch`, working in cross-language R/Python environment using Reticulate, and data visualizations using animation and interactivity by means of `streamlit` and `shiny` for Python frameworks. I am passionate about gravel and road cycling as well as indie Cinema.
